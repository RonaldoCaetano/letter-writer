# Code of Conduct

We strive to be welcoming towards all contributors, regardless of experience, expertise, or background.  As such, please follow these simple rules.

1. Have fun.
2. Be welcoming. This project is more about giving new contributors the opportunity to work on a real project than it is about being perfect.
3. No offensive language in PR or issue comments
4. Be patient as issues are being worked on.  It's ok to check in on stale issues if you'd like to work on it, but please be careful not to pressure a contributor who may be struggle.  When in doubt, ask if a contributor could use help instead of asking if you can take the work from them.
